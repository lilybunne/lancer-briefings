# Mission // #001
## Parallel-Transport
# Goals
- Infiltrate the freight-tunnels via the abandoned maintenence station.
- Reach Checkpoint 5.C.21, acquire a network link with your liaison in the city.
  - Authorised to eliminate military and law-enforcement assets that may jeopardize mission status.

# Stakes
- Time is critical. The negotiations between Union and Tolamor are quickly souring, and if conflict breaks out before you can infiltrate the city proper, the mission zone will become complex to navigate.  

# Reserves
- None at this time.
