Jianghu Penal Colony had been abandoned by its former administrators for generations. A brutal domain of petty warlords where the strong devoured the weak; one had to either prove their strength to those around them or stay so hidden as to barely exist in order to survive. It is this environment that Gu Laoshen was born and raised. 

The Gu Clan was not an easy place for one to develop. Based on a creed of pitting its own against each other, having them devour one another in combat until the final survivor was a tried and tested master. It was rife with internal conflicts, not to mention the day to day skirmishes of Jianghu as a whole. Gu Laoshen survived by enduring the hostilities of those stronger than him through sheer strength of body and force of will, gradually building up his own power and skill until he could overcome his antagonists - a task he would inevitably accomplish, whether that was a case of over weeks, months, or even years. Much as he might hate the idea, Laoshen was everything the Gu creed strove to create.

Laoshen had been a Clan Lieutenant for three years when the fighting on Jianghu suddenly grew more intense. The conflicts between the warlord clans grew more common, fiercer. New devastating weaponry surfaced, seemingly out of nowhere. Massacres became commonplace as old grudges and blood feuds were settled in brutal and final fashion. It was a matter of months before the penal colony was a hollow shell, with only a handful of survivors on all sides. Of the Gu Clan, Laoshen was the sole survivor - surviving day by day amid the burning wreckage of the clan's districts, accompanied by a handful of others whose clans had been similarly brought to ruin.

In the latter days of Jianghu's fall, it was uncovered that people from outside of Jianghu were the ones behind the fires of this conflict - corporation scouts who had stumbled onto the lost colony. These scouts had decided to take advantage of Union's absence on the forgotten penal colony in order to circumvent the Third Committee's laws. They would use the Jianghi populace as live testing data for their experimental weaponry by providing it to the warlords and observing the ensuing conflict. Unfortunately these scouts underestimated Jianghu's creed of vengeance. They underestimated the wrath and resourcefulness of those forged in the fires of Jianghu's battles. The scouts did not escape the penal colony.

It was after another 3 months of futilely attempting to rebuild, ironically the most peaceful Jianghu had been in decades, before Union arrived. Initially greeted with hostility and suspicion, they slowly managed to prove their good intentions by providing relief aid in whatever form they could; eventually completely shutting down the penal colony and giving the hundred or so survivors the care and resources they need to attempt to integrate into the nearest actual colony. 

Laoshen tried to adjust to life outside of Jianghu, he really did. But Laoshen was forged in strife, in glorious struggle. He found himself constantly at odds with those around him, scrapping and brawling as if he never left Jianghu, much to the dismay of the local Union authorities. While it was never more than a day or so before he ended up back in a detention cell for therapy, he never did lasting damage, always stopping when he realised just 
how badly he outclassed the poor drunk fools he faced.

It was half a year of passing to and fro from bar to detention facility to psychiatric evaluation when Laoshen had a strange but fortuitous encounter. A particularly boisterous group clad in matching uniform had invaded his local bar, interrupting a night that had until then been comfortably quiet. At first, he kept himself restrained. After all, his latest psychiatrist appointment had told him about this Cognitive Behavioural....something something. Self control was simply another form of training. But then one of them had to go and spill his drink. He reacted in a flurry of violence before he'd even consciously processed what had happened, already regretting that he was going to be standing over the poor fool like he always did. Only.... He wasn't. The woman who'd jostled him had spun with his punch, returning with a hefty side kick of her own. A mad grin spread across his face as the two traded blows back and forth in a lightning flurry of martial prowess, as the bar erupted with shouts and cheers around them. After 10 solid minutes of testing each others limits, they collapsed into the bar's side booth, exhausted and laughing like fools. These were the first folk to truly earn Laoshen's respect since leaving Jianghu. They talked throughout the night, the woman and her squadmates sharing stories about their operations as Laoshen responded with tales of some of the more interesting conflicts he'd found himself in over the years. Eventually, the night drew to a close, and they were to part ways. The woman gave him a card, with her Company's information. Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company.  "Come join us in the garbage men of the galaxy!", the woman had said with a grin. A warm sense of anticipation grew in Laoshen's chest. He would do just that.

To date Laoshen has been with Mirrorsmoke for five years. Participated in a variety of operations across the board, before eventually finding himself a place as a member of the mechanised cavalry of MSMC 808th Detachment. He had comrades, he had conflict, he had everything he needed in order to continue down his chosen path. Gu Laoshen had finally found his place outside Jianghu, and he was thriving in it.
