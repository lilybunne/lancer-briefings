Born on a remote colony world in the outskirts of the Long Rim, Kutoja grew up amid the harsh realities of life on the fringes. His early years were marked by poverty and violence, as he and his family struggled to survive the lawless frontier.

As he came of age, Kutoja sought a way out of the cycle of hardship that had defined his upbringing. He showed remarkable aptitude for medicine and was determined to use this talent to make a better life for himself and the people he saw suffer endlessly around him. He enrolled in a medical school program aboard Blink Station Lucretia, working long days in the hospital, and longer nights scraping together every credit he could find to fund his education.

After a decade of training, Kutoja became a skilled surgeon, specializing in trauma surgery and psychological care. But he soon realized that his skills were in high demand on the front lines of the conflicts that plagued the 3rd Committee's reclaimation of the galactic fringe. He enlisted in the MirrorsSmoke Mercenary Company, finding a sense of purpose in providing medical aid to soldiers in the heat of battle.
Kutoja's disillusionment grew as he witnessed the horrors of war up close. He became acutely aware of the toll it took on the minds of soldiers, not just their bodies. This realization led him to embrace the mechanized chassis, the human body too is a machine, how much harder could it be to learn than brain surgery? Combining this with psychological warfare as a means of survival, he honed his skills in the art of manipulation, using his knowledge of human psychology to destabilize and harn enemy forces and protect his own.

He used his established connections with the MSMC, he seeking out the Grammaton Monks approval to licence a Calendula for use. The Calendula's frame design and advanced systems allowed him to broadcast eerie sounds and cryptic messages to sow confusion among his adversaries. His call sign, "Bell Witch," became synonymous with dread on the battlefield, as his enemies never knew when they might hear the haunting toll of a phantom bell, signaling their impending doom.

On the battlefield, using advanced legionspace warfare techniques, KTB technology and sensory manipulation to sow confusion and fear among his foes. In an everchanging battlefield situation, the ability to simply vanish and pick off targets with surgical precision became a valuable asset for the 808th.
Now, at the age of 53, Kutoja continues to serve as the Bell Witch, using his medical expertise and psychological warfare skills to protect his fellow mercenaries and survive the chaos of interstellar conflict. Though the years have left their mark on him, both physically and mentally, he remains dedicated to his mission, determined to make a difference in a universe that often seems beyond redemption.
