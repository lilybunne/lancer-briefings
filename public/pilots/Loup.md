Lenore Seprith was a lieutenant in the 87th Orbital Vanguard Regiment of the 45th Scout “Double Shield” Division. Her regiment specialized in dropping into hostile areas to secure a landing zone for the rest of the unit.

While her service record was by no means long or illustrious, she was a competent and respected officer to those that knew her.

During a dangerous but unremarkable mission, her mech was destroyed, requiring her to pilot a new one until it could be repaired. Officers in the 45th Scout Division were assigned the Argent, a Sargarmatha pattern optimized for their usual mission parameters. Lieutenant Seprith was assigned a mech almost identical to her old one, and thought nothing of it, being immediately given a new mission.

The last thing she remembered was making planet fall, followed by a blur of intense, incomprehensible memory. Sensory data her body did not know how to interprete. She woke up kilometers away from the battlefield, exhausted, and in the middle of a forest out of range of any contact.

By the time she found her way out of it, she was just in time to see the last of her Division extract and withdraw from the planet. Marooned, and with no idea what had happened, Lenore began to investigate the situation, reviewing her mech’s mission records.

What she found horrified her. She had gone berserk, dealing considerable damage to both sides of the conflict with weapons and parameters far outside the Argent’s capabilities. Her comm chatter at the time had been completely incomprehensible rambling. She wasn’t sure if her subordinates had survived her rampage or not.

Investigating the mech further, she found that it was not a standard model Argent as she had suspected, but instead something called the Argent LUNA, some kind of experimental test prototype. Still no clue as to how she had ended up being assigned it, and still marooned, she began to scavenge for supplies.

After camping on the planet for around two weeks, a passing Mirror Smoke Mercenary Company ship picked up her signal while investigating elsewhere on the planet, and Lenore was able to bargain for a lift. However, when she attempted to pay for this service, she found her finances had been completely frozen, and she held liable for what had occurred.

With few other options, Lenore joined up with the MSMC, both to pay back her debt to them and try to restablish enough of a legal identity to clear her own name… or start a new life entirely.

During her time marooned, she managed to learn by trial and error how to maintain (mostly) in control of the mech during combat, and thus continued to use it in the MSMC.

Lenore is of average height with long black hair. Her eyes are a piercing, unnatural red, the result of an ill-advised cosmetic surgery she purchased as a teenager that she has decided to live with rather than foot the bill for fixing.
