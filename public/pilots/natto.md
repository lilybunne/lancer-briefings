Hellstar inherited much from her family, a comfortable life, a high ranking position in a weapons manufacturing company, and good looks of course. But the thing she cherishes most that she inherited was her brain. She considers herself to be very smart, and insatiably curious about everything, including people. But she also inherited a pedestal. Expectations. Responsibilities. Constraints. All of them growing larger than each other by the minute. By the time she turned 21 and it was time to take the title of CEO, she vanished, only leaving behind an explosion that burnt down her room and her mech missing from the garage.

She would move on to being a mercenary, she knew that was the way to get money so she could make what she loved. The freedom allowed by her travels invigorated her designs and she became inspired by the people she met along the way, even if she was a bit too trusting at first.
