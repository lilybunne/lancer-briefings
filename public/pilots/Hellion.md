A weary woman from an impoverished, non-Union Periphery state. Helen Stane joined Mirrorsmoke twelve years ago to wipe away debt and earn basic certifications, escaping the poverty that kept her terrestrial. She is a career mercenary, albeit one who feels trapped in her profession. She knows little other than the dangerous, difficult life of the merc. For most of it, she's been infantry within MSMC 501st Detachment, the 'One-Eyed Fox.' Her specialisation was as a forward-controller that coordinated Infantry units she was part of, and Mechanised Cavalry units.

Helen described the high casualty rates of MSMC infantry units as 'the churn', and her promotions were relatively rapid. In ten years, she went from a new recruit to a senior non-commissioned officer. As a coping mechanism with the high stress and having no idea of what she could possibly do in civilian life, Helen has a well-hidden but definite addiction to the drug Freeze. Freeze keeps a pilot calm and emotionally stable; deadening fear and other strong reactions.

Two years ago on her decade-anniversary of service, Helen was given the opportunity to test for becoming a 'Mech pilot. She showed good-enough aptitude and was sent to train in it, changing specialisation from liaison to mech pilot herself. During training she was given her callsign 'Hellion' as a play on her name, and the aggressive tactics she preferred.

After re-training and qualifications were completed on the Everest and then Sherman-pattern mechs, Helen was given a commission (and equivalent payrise) to Lieutenant. She leads the Mechanised Cavalry Platoon of the 808th MSMC Company, assigned to the MSMS Old Haunts. Fireteam HAVOC, as they've become known, is a new and untested unit - Lieutenant Stane has commanded her subordinates on some minor missions. 

What comes next will be Hellion's first real test in the Mechanised Cavalry.

## Appearance
34 years old, 5'4" with long brown hair, and light brown eyes. She has a peculiar accent - if anyone knows her home planet of Gloucester, it's distinctly low-class in nature.

Helen carries herself somewhat quietly, it's hard to get close to her. While not aloof, it's clear she keeps everyone at just a little bit of distance, a product of her long time as a mercenary. She's loved and lost a few too many times. She's spent too much time under the influence of Freeze.
