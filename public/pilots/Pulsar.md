Leah P. Nightingale was born to a poor couple on a medium sized station on the rim. Her father a hydroponics engineer and her mother a construction worker. Together they made enough to live comfortably enough with a child until an accident took Leah's father at a young age. Leaving Leah from a young age to assist with the maintenance of her mother's construction chassis to keep up with a higher workload. It wasn't an easy life, but they managed to survive.

The spark that would alter the trajectory of Leah's life was when a band of local pirates had laid siege to her station. Intending to cut it off from all supplies and perform a lengthy trail of hit and run strikes to preclude an all out assault. For weeks the occupants had to endure the terror of fluctuating power and the ever-present threat of running out of oxygen as vital systems were attacked and barely managed to be repaired.. Even if one could survive the initial takeover, there was no telling what horrors the "new management" would bring.

Satisfied with their campaign of terror, the pirates broke through into the station, quickly dispatching whatever little resistance the security teams could muster up. Just as all hope was lost. A savior arrived.

Slipping out of FTL, a wing of Albatross responding to the station's distress signal arrived in a blink, announcing their presence with a beam of brilliant blue light splitting one of the pirate's ships in two. The leader of the Albatross Wing touched down personally to repel the invaders. Leah watched from a small slit in a blast door as a crimson-painted Sherman MK1 ripped and tore through the opposition with skill, finesse, and raw might. The image of it standing triumphant above the wreckage of the pirate captain's Tortuga forever etched into her mind. 

The aftermath had the young pilot-to-be completely throw herself into the world of mechanics and pistons and servos. Taking over her mother's job in piloting the maintenance equipment to learn the ins and outs of piloting while supporting her aging mother. A passion had awakened within, she would be a Lancer, a hero akin to the knights of old. All of her free time was dedicated to this pursuit, a consuming vortex of outdated simulators, piloting manuals, combat footage, and studying what little internals she could get her eyes or hands on.

One day a couple of men sporting MSMC uniforms arrived on station, recruiters, not pilots. Along with them a representative of a company named GH Heavy Industries. The latter of which no one on the rim had ever heard of before.

They'd been hopping along, trying to entice potential pilots, selling a life of adventure, traveling, and glory to the few that'd hear it. A contract with MSMC and potential to become a test pilot for GHHI. Leah wasn't blind to the kind of work MSMC was inclined to. This wouldn't be the heroic world saving she'd envisioned, but this was Leah's chance at her dream--it was a start, a stepping stone. An avenue to build a reputation, resources, a legacy. 

Years of savings was dumped into getting a frame fit to meet the requirements, and the recruiter's spiel managed to push away enough doubt for her to sign on the dotted line.

One way or another, she will etch her name into the stars.
